algorithm to find the minimum common multiple

>>>Assistant:
To find the minimum common multiple of two numbers, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. Multiply the two numbers together.
3. Divide the product of the two numbers by the GCD to get the minimum common multiple.

Here is a simple implementation of the algorithm in Python:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Example usage
num1 = 12
num2 = 18
result = lcm(num1, num2)
print(f"The minimum common multiple of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}")
```

You can replace `num1` and `num2` with the numbers you want to find the minimum common multiple of.
